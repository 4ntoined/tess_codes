stupid photo plot:

split x axis at 2459951, resume at ...54
y-range is like 12.5-13.5 and 14.25-12.75

for tail widths: we assume tail (peak) stays +- 7 pixels,
protect 191 to 209, middle 19 pixels, from continuum measure
whole range is 41 pixels, leavng 41-19=41-(20-1)=41-20+1=21+1
22 pixels left so 11 to average on each flank,
to first order we'll just fit a line
